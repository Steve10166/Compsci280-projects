  <h1>Project 0: Becoming Friends with Your Camera</h1>

  <!-- Part 1 -->
  <h2>Part 1: Selfie — The Wrong Way vs. The Right Way</h2>
  <p>
    Take a picture of your friend (or yourself) from close up. You get a typical distorted selfie image. 
    Now step back several feet from your subject, zoom in, and take a second picture. 
    Try to get the face in the second photo to be the same size as in the first photo. 
    If you've done things right, the second portrait should look much better than the first one. 
    Think about why this is.
  </p>

  <div class="images">

      <img src="project0/close_selfie.jpg" alt="Close-up selfie">
      <figcaption>The Wrong Way: Close-up Selfie</figcaption>
    </figure>

      <img src="project0/far_selfie.jpg" alt="Far away selfie">
      <figcaption>The Right Way: Step Back & Zoom In</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>
  <p>
    When you take a selfie too close, your face looks weird because the camera makes your nose big and your head stretched. 
    If you step back and zoom in, your face looks normal and more like how people see you in real life.
  </p>

  <!-- Part 2 -->
  <h2>Part 2: Architectural Perspective Compression</h2>
  <p>
    Let's repeat the same procedure in reverse, for an urban scene. Pick a nice view down a long street (or a walking path on campus), 
    zoom in, and take a photo. Now, walk down the street in the direction of your first shot, and take a second photo without zoom, 
    such that the scene in the two photos appears approximately the same size. 
    The first picture should look flattened, or compressed, compared to the second. Again, think about why.
  </p>

  <div class="images">
    <figure>
      <img src="project0/close_building.jpg" alt="Zoomed-in urban scene">
      <figcaption>Compressed View: Zoomed In</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <img src="project0/far_building.jpg" alt="Wide urban scene">
      <figcaption>Expanded View: Close with Wide Angle</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>
  <p>
    When you zoom in from far away, the scene looks flatter because distances are compressed. 
    Up close with no zoom, the perspective feels stretched, showing more depth in the street.
  </p>

  <!-- Part 3 -->
  <h2>Part 3: The Dolly Zoom</h2>
  <p>
    In this part, we will be duplicating a classic film effect called the dolly zoom. 
    It is a camera movement also known as the <em>"Vertigo shot"</em>, after a famous scene in Hitchcock's <em>Vertigo</em>. 
    Here are some examples of this effect in cinema:
  </p>

      <img src="project0/hitchcock.gif" alt="Dolly zoom effect example">
      <figcaption>Example of the Dolly Zoom (Vertigo Shot)</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>

  <p>
    The idea is to simultaneously move the camera back while also zooming in. First, come up with a good setting for the shot 
    (e.g., a scene with stuffed animals is one popular choice). Now take a few (4–8 or even more!) still photos while you move 
    the camera back and zoom in, keeping the resulting image roughly the same size. Combine your stills into an animated GIF 
    file—you have a dolly zoom!
